## OMDB Film Browser

Mobile app to search and display film titles from the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdb.org/).

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)
following insructions from [this article](http://jkaufman.io/react-web-native-codesharing/).

## Demo

* [Expo](https://expo.io/@lsiden/omdb-film-browser)
* [Google Play Store Beta Test](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.westsideconsultingllc.omdbViewer)

## Roadmap

1.  Locally cache OMDB API responses for speed on subsequent requests with same parameters.
1.  After I get some feedback from Beta Program testers and release the app to the general public on the Google Play store, I may attempt to get the app accepted on the Apple Store.
